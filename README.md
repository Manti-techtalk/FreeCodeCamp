This repository showcases my ongoing efforts outside the classroom to master the foundational technologies of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through diligent practice and dedication, I'm actively building a strong skillset to pursue a career in software engineering. Feel free to explore my projects, exercises, and accompanying notes to gain insights into my learning process. I welcome feedback and collaboration opportunities
